        <h2>What AIs are Being Used?</h2>
        <p>ChatGPT is by far the most popular AI platform, especially among college students. It is used widely among college students for generating essays, completing assignments, and answering questions on quizzes and tests.</p>

        <h2>What is ChatGPT?</h2>
        <p>ChatGPT is a chatbot and generative AI designed to simulate human conversation. Developed by OpenAI and released in 2022, it has since made a significant impact in technology and discussions about the future.</p>
        <p><strong>Generative AI</strong></p>
        <p>Generative AI creates new content. This is how people can generate AI-produced images, videos, and text. The newest editions of ChatGPT are considered generative AI, which has made the platform even more popular.</p>

        <h3>Studies Show 1/3 of College Students Use AI</h3>
        <p>The data shown below is from Science Direct, highlighting STEM majors' use of AI and how it is distributed across different school activities.</p>

        <p>Studies reveal that most students claim to use AI for ethical purposes, like tutoring or refining their research work. According to a Harvard study, students describe AI as a “tutor” rather than a “cheater.” However, where do we draw the line between artificial tutoring and plagiarism?</p>
        <p>If students are using AI as a study buddy, is that acceptable to professors and other academics? It seems to be. As we’ll see below, more universities are adopting AI programs for students.</p>

        <p>A growing number of universities are adapting, unsure how to approach AIs like ChatGPT. A rising number of institutions now offer courses and majors in AI, including UW-Eau Claire, which will offer an Artificial Intelligence major starting in Fall 2025. Colleges are preparing for the surge in AI use in higher education. These majors focus less on programming AI and more on the concepts and how to understand and utilize AI to its full potential.</p>

        <p>In addition, many institutions are revising syllabi to address the rise of AI. As Kirk McLaren of Forbes writes: “The journey of integrating AI into business education is both challenging and exciting. It offers a path to creating more engaging, personalized, and effective learning experiences that prepare students for the realities of the modern business world” (McLaren). McLaren takes a very optimistic approach to AI in business classrooms and speaks to the new opportunities that AI may create. Many people seem to agree that AI can be a tool for students—and not just for business students.</p>
        
        <p>So far, we haven’t seen many proven negatives of using AI in the classroom—only potential risks. Surprisingly, the majority of discussion has focused on how AI can be a helpful tool in education. However, we will now explore the real concerns people have about AI use in schools.</p>
        
        <hr> 
        <h4><strong>The Negatives</strong></h4>
        <p>While ChatGPT can generate new ideas and help students practice, it still relies on pulling information from existing sources across the web and often doesn’t cite where that information comes from. Plagiarism is one of the biggest concerns regarding the use of AI like ChatGPT. What concerns many educators is not just the accuracy, but the possibility of student laziness. Critics argue that students who rely on AI are less creative and less motivated to learn.</p>
        <p>We'll examine this more on the next page. One major issue is how AI use can divide students. “In-groups” and “out-groups” may form in classrooms depending on who uses AI and who doesn’t. This could be especially problematic for business students, where success depends heavily on teamwork, communication, and collaboration.</p>
