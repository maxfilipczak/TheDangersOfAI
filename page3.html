    <h2>The Good and Bad of Using AI (Simply Put)</h2>
    <p><strong>The Good:</strong> AI can promote technological innovation and efficiency in learning.</p>
    <p><strong>The Bad:</strong> AI can encourage laziness and lead to plagiarism. Many students are becoming increasingly dependent on it.</p>

    <h3>AI in the Workplace</h3>
    <p>ChatGPT is not just affecting education—it also has the potential to impact future careers. According to <em>Forbes</em>, careers in creative fields, journalism, and even programming may be among the first to experience disruptions.</p>
    <p>Could this reflect the in-group and out-group biases that AI might introduce—not just in classrooms, but in the workforce as well?</p>

    <h3>AI's Growing Workplace Impact</h3>
    <p>The in-groups created in college are being translated to the workplace as well. Employees who use AI are being viewed as lazy and producing lower quality work by their colleagues. Over 50% of American workers have reported using AI, and 16% say they use AI frequently at work.</p>

    <p>AI is still a new concept in the workplace, and universities and employers are still unsure how to regulate and set rules for using it. "Twenty percent of workers worry that ChatGPT is taking jobs from honest workers, but many feel it helps them work 'smarter, not harder.'" (<em>Brooks, 2023</em>)</p>

    <p>This is another reason we ask when to draw the line. As universities are figuring out how to regulate AI, what should employers do about it? Should it be seen as a tool or regulated like it is at universities?</p>

    <p>A lazy student who uses AI, will graduate and start to use AI at work, and as stated before, there is already a gap in the users vs. non-users of AI. This stems from AI use in the classroom.</p>
